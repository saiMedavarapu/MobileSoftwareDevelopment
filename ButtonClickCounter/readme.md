## Homework Description:
Using Android Studio, design a Tap Button Counter App. At first launch, the application user
interface should appear in landscape orientation. The objective of the app is to count how many
times the user taps the button. The count result should be displayed in a text field and updated
after each tap on the button. When the user exits the application and then relaunches it, make
sure the count number reset back to 0. The interface screen must display a “Tap” or “Tap me”
Button and a message with a count number (which is initialized to 0). Use a Linerlayout,
TextViews, ImageViews, Buttons, and other concepts that you learnt in the class.

##Implementation.

This is implemented in Java using Onclick listeners. Inside the source code look at the Activity2.java and Activity2.xml files for logic.
