### Task

Using Android Studio, design a Calculator App. This app should appear only in portrait
orientation (should not work for landscape orientation). Calculator app enables the users to
perform the fundamental mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, as well as some advance mathematical operations such as square root, square, and cube of a number.
Also include the “clear” operation in your calculator to clear the display screen.
